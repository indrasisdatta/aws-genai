AWS EC2 configuration:

1) Using root, create a new policy for EC2 access and add it to "developer" user.
2) Login as developer user and create a new EC2 instance.

Security Group - check inbound and outbound rules 
Inbound should have port 22 for SSH 

VPC -> Subnet -> Route Table -> Security Group -> EC2 

Issue: URL keeps loading 
Fix: Add Security Group port 80 rule for inbound 

Unable to open AWS instance connect as developer user but works as root. 
Fix: Update policy:
    "ec2:DescribeInstances",
    "ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey"

SSH command to connect to AWS instance:
ssh -i idatta.pub ec2-user@ec2-13-203-200-245.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
